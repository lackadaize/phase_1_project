# Star Wars Characters
### Purpose
Everything you need to know about your favorite Star Wars characters.

### Description

"Star Wars Characters" is an app that lets you select Star Wars characters based on the movie(s) they appeared in, currently only those from the original trilogy and the prequels. The characters appear in a random order each time the page is loaded.  When individual characters are clicked it shows more information about the character such as species, homeworld, birth year, height, mass, hair color, skin color, and eye color. As of Version 1.0 the app is not yet optimized for mobile display.
