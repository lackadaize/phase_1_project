# Star Wars Characters
### Purpose
Everything you need to know about your favorite Star Wars characters.

### Description

"Star Wars Characters" is an app that lets you select Star Wars characters based on the movie(s) they appeared in, currently only including those from the original trilogy and the prequels. The characters appear in a random order each time the page is loaded.  When individual characters are clicked it shows more information about the character such as species, homeworld, birth year, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, and films. 

As of Version 1.0 the app is not yet optimized for mobile display.  Also, for my fellow geeks and nerds, there are key values in some of the character objects in the database that don't match the reality of the films.  From what I see that mostly applies in terms of which films the characters appear in.
