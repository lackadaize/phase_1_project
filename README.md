# Star Wars Characters
### Purpose
Everything you need to know about your favorite Star Wars characters.

### Description

"Star Wars Characters" is an app that lets you select Star Wars characters based on the movie(s) they appeared in, currently only those from the original trilogy and the prequels. The characters appear in a random order each time the page is loaded.  When individual characters are clicked it shows more information about the character such as species, homeworld, birth year, height, mass, hair color, skin color, and eye color. As of Version 1.0 the app is not yet optimized for mobile display.  

## Technologies Used
### Languages

JavaScript, JSON, HTML5, CSS

### API

JSON cloned to local server from https://swapi.dev and modified to include image urls and convert 'character' data from urls to strings.

## Stretch Goals from Flatiron School

If you think your blog post and/or video are really good and would add value, add them to your README.md.

If you want to go above and beyond, record a few seconds of yourself navigating the app and turn it into a gif. Then, add the gif in your README.md. That way anyone can get a sense of how your app works without leaving the README's page on GitHub!
